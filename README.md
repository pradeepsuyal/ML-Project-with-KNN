## INTRODUCTION
-----------------
I have taken a classisificaion datset in which I used KNearestNieghbors Model for Prediction

## KNN
-------------------
K Nearest Neighbors is a classification algorithm that operates on a very simple principle. Building the model consists only of storing the training dataset. To make a prediction for a new data point, the algorithm finds the closest data points in the training dataset — i.e., its “nearest neighbors.”
